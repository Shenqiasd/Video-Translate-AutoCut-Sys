# Codex Task T2.1: Dependency inventory + status UI (Desktop)

Repo: `Video-Translate-AutoCut-Sys/KrillinAI`
Branch: `feat/desktop-native-step1-appcore`

## Goal

Show a clear dependency status panel in the Windows desktop UI so first-run users understand what is missing and what to do next.

## Requirements

- Define dependency tiers:
  - Must: ffmpeg, ffprobe (and ytdlp if URL download is used)
  - Should: edge-tts (if local tts is enabled)
  - Optional: whisper local binaries (fasterwhisper/whispercpp/whisperx/whisperkit)
- Implement a small dependency status model (name, required tier, resolved path, status ok/missing/error, hint).
- Resolution rules:
  - Prefer resolved paths set in `internal/storage` (from deps checker), else `exec.LookPath`.
  - Do NOT download/install in T2.1; just show status and hints.
- UI:
  - Add a section/card in Desktop Settings (or Dashboard) that lists deps with status.
  - Include a button "Run Diagnose" which runs the backend `--diagnose` output or shows the same info.
  - Include a button placeholder "Fix/Install" that will be wired in T2.2.
- Tests:
  - Unit test dependency resolution logic without requiring actual binaries.

## Files

- `internal/deps/checker.go` (reuse logic if safe)
- `internal/storage/bin.go` (paths)
- `internal/desktop/ui.go` / settings tab code
- Add new files under `internal/deps/` or `internal/desktop/` as needed

## Validation

- `go test ./...` passes
- Keep non-Windows behavior compatible
