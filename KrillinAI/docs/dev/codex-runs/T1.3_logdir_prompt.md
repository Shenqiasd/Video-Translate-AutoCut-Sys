# Codex Task T1.3: Log directory uses portable LogDir

Repo: `Video-Translate-AutoCut-Sys/KrillinAI`
Branch: `feat/desktop-native-step1-appcore`

## Goal

In portable-by-default mode (Windows), logs must be written under `data/logs/` next to the executable.

## Current Behavior

`log.InitLogger()` currently writes to a default location (likely working dir / fixed path). We need to make it write to the resolved directory from `internal/appdirs.Resolve()`.

## Requirements

- Default Windows behavior is portable. Use `internal/appdirs.Resolve().LogDir`.
- Non-Windows behavior should remain backward compatible.
- The directory should be created automatically.
- Keep console logging.
- Add/adjust a `--diagnose` field to show where logs are written.

## Files to inspect

- `log/` package (logger init)
- `cmd/desktop/main.go`
- `cmd/server/main.go` (if any)
- `cmd/desktop/flags.go` diagnose output

## Output

- Code changes that redirect log output to resolved LogDir.
- `go test ./...` passes.
